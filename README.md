# MBS FRONTEND ASSIGNMENT

Welcome to the Mangrovia Blockchain Solutions Frontend Assignment =)

## Introduction

For this assignment what you'll build is a simple page app for querying and navigate a dataset of cat facts. \
The cat facts are powered by [`catfacts.ninja`](https://catfact.ninja/#/).

The app will be powered by `javascript`, `react` and [`Semantic UI`](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).

This project is powered by `yarn`. \
Once cloned this project can be installed with `yarn install`.
You can run scripts with `yarn start`.

## Tasks

Use the provided hook `useCatFacts` to load a list of facts on cats.
Use components in `Semantic UI` library to create a page with this capabilities:

- display 15 facts per page
- if `hasNextPage` is true add the possibility to load more results
- possibility to bookmark a fact
  - the bookmarked facts will be displayed in a sided list

## Submission

You can submit your work through:

- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io)
- ...other

## Evaluation

Our goal is to find answers to those questions:

- Do you understand the JavaScript language and more in general web technologies?
- Can you design interfaces that are clear and easy to use?
- Do you master your working environment?

Due to the limited time consider the followings:

- It is NOT important to have a fully functional application at the end.
- We'll develop just for the latest version of Google Chrome.
